Games I've made for the ComputerCraft game console, Goldcube!<br>

Archives will need 'progdor2' to unpack. It can be found here:<br>

Of course, you will also need to set up the game console in Minecraft:<br>

| How to Play Games: |
|--------------------|

Put an empty floppy disk into your ingame disk drive, then use the following commands:
```
progdor2 -pb ID "disk/gcgame"
label set right "GAME NAME"
```
**ID** - The file name of the game, as seen in the repository<br>
**GAME NAME** - The name of the folder containing the game file.<br>

Now you should be able to click 'Play Game Disk' to launch your game.
